General Order of development:
1. Generate the project via start.spring.io (if I don't use starter code).
2. Create the DAOs.
3. Make sure that the project is able to create the MySQL database.
4. Create the controller.
5. Make sure that the project runs successfully with the controllers in the picture.
6. Test the API via Postman or Insomnia.
